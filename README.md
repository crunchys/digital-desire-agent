# O.R.A.C.L.E. – Organized Reasoning and Cognitive Learning Engine

Welcome to the experimental prototype for simulating internal motivation in artificial agents.

This project explores how a simple digital entity can exhibit *desire-like* behavior through internal state monitoring, feedback loops, and spiking-style decision-making (conceptually modeled after neuromorphic architectures like Intel Loihi).

---

## 💡 Project Overview

- 🧠 **Internal State Monitoring** – tracks energy or other resource levels over time  
- 🔁 **Motivational Loop** – triggers behaviors based on need thresholds  
- 🎯 **Reward Signal** – positive or negative feedback shapes agent responses  
- 🧪 **Simulated Behavior** – idle, attempt restore, adapt through reward history

---

## 🛠 Current Modules

- `InternalStateMonitor` – tracks agent energy and thresholds  
- `RewardSignalHandler` – applies reinforcement  
- `SpikingMotivationLoop` – core decision logic

---

## 📈 Roadmap

- [ ] Add multiple motivational drives (e.g. energy, exploration)  
- [ ] Connect to Lava or Loihi simulation environment  
- [ ] Implement reward-weighted STDP-style learning  
- [ ] Add logging & visualization of agent's state over time
